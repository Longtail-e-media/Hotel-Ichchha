## 📝 Frontend Documentation

### 1. For Deployment on Cloudflare:
``` plaintext
1. Go to the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Select the website you want to deploy.
3. Go to the `Workers & Pages` tab.
4. Connect your GitHub repository.
5. Select the branch you want to deploy.
6. Click on the `Deploy` button.
    - use the following command: `pnpm run build`
    - use the following directory: `dist`
```

### 2. For Deployment on Longtail cpanel server:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
and then upload the build folder to the server on the root directory.

`NOTE:` Add these files for no production error:

- Create a `.htaccess` file in the root directory of the project and add the following code:
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```
`NOTE:` This code will redirect all the requests to the index.html file which prevents the 404 error after user navigates to the different pages and refreshes the page.

#### [Optional]: Only if the folder has /folder-name in the URL then add the following code:

`.htaccess`
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /folder-name/
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /folder-name/index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

`vite.config.js`
```jsx
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/folder-name/',
})
```

`App.tsx`
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

<Router basename="/folder-name">
  <App />
</Router>
```
